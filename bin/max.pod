=head1 DESCRIPTION

For instructions and examples, please refer to the main documentation
in the C<README.md> file of this distribution.

Usage: C<< max [<loop|watch> [<interval>]] [<subcommand> <args> \; <subcommand> <args> \; ...)

=head2 Modifiers

When the first argument is C<loop> or C<watch>, the subcommands are repeated every I<interval> seconds. If no interval is specified, it will default to 10 seconds.

C<loop> will add an empty line between the outputs, C<watch> will clear the screen before each subcommand.

=head2 Subcommands

When no subcommand is given, C<summary> is used.

Multiple subcommands can be specified by separating them by a C<;>. Note that
the C<;> will probably need escaping or quoting (e.g. C<\;> or C<';'>) and must
be an argument by itself, i.e. separated by whitespace on the shell command
line.

=head3 config <device_id|room_id|type|C<all>> display <setting>

Configures which temperature the thermostat should display: either the
C<setpoint> or the C<current>.

=head3 config <device_id|room_id|type|C<all>> temperatures <comfort> <eco> <max> <min>

C<temperatures> may be abbreviated as C<temp>.

Configures the comfort ("day") and eco ("night") presets, and the limits for
the on-device temperature control.

To keep the current value for any of these temperatures, provide C<0> or C<''>.
When fewer than 4 numbers are given, the remaining ones default to keeping the
current value.

=head3 crosslink <room_id>

For each of the devices in a room, commands the device to link with each of the
other devices in that room.

=head3 dump

Outputs a debug dump of the internal state after conncting

=head3 pair <room_id>

Initiates the pairing of a new device and configures the device's room id.

=head3 set <room_id|C<all>> <temperature|eco|comfort>

Sends a new temperature to the devices in a room, forcing the mode to I<manual>.
Specify C<all> instead of a numeric room ID to set the temperature everywhere.

=head3 summary

Outputs a list of rooms with values from the room's devices.

=head3 status

Outputs a summary of device attributes, grouped by room.

=head3 mqtt <hostname> <topic_prefix>

Publishes device attributes to the given MQTT server. Currently does not
support any authentication or TLS. The I<topic_prefix> should not end in C</>,
as one is added by the program.

The messages are sent with the I<retain> flag enabled, and consist of the
numeric decimal value, a space, and the corresponding unit.

=head3 switch <command> [<on> <off>]

Determines whether there is a demand for heat, and runs the given shell command
accordingly. C<command> is a sprintf-like format and should only contain a
single C<%s> placeholder. Any other C<%> character should be escaped as C<%%>.
If no C<%s> is given, it is added at the end so that it becomes a command line
argument.

C<on> defaults to C<1>, C<off> defaults to C<0>.

=head3 name <room_id|device_id> <name>

Sets the name for a room (numeric id) or device (6 digit hexadecimal id) and
writes the metadata back to the Cube.

=head3 reboot

Reboots the Cube.

=head2 Environment variables

=head3 MAX_HOST

Can be set to the hostname or IPv4 address of the Cube to disable automatic
discovery.
